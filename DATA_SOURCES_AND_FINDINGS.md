## 🎯 Key Insights and Conclusions

### Critical Findings:

1. **Gaps Are Significant and Widening**
   - Both countries show statistically significant wage gaps
   - Trend analysis indicates WORSENING conditions (gaps increasing)
   - North Macedonia's gap nearly 5× larger than 2009 baseline

2. **Private Sector Shows Larger Disparities**
   - Private sector gaps consistently 5-10 percentage points higher
   - Public sector offers more equitable compensation

   - Serbia data shows peak gap at ages 35-39 (20.19%)
   - Coincides with prime career/family years
   - Suggests "motherhood penalty" or career progression barriers

5. **Regional Variation Exists**
   - Urban areas (Belgrade) show larger gaps
   - May reflect different labor market dynamics
   - Capital cities may have more pronounced disparities

### Comparative Analysis: NM vs Serbia

- **Wage Gap:** North Macedonia (17.9%) vs Serbia (11.0%)
  - NM has 6.9 percentage point WIDER gap

## 📝 Methodology Notes

### Data Validation Process:
1. Cross-referenced multiple sources
2. Checked for consistency across years
3. Verified calculations against published reports
4. Identified and documented outliers
5. Standardized measurements and currencies

### Limitations:
1. Some years have limited data points
2. Sectoral breakdowns not available for all years
3. Currency fluctuations not adjusted (local currency values)
4. Some estimates based on research rather than official data
5. Kosovo, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Montenegro have fewer data points

### Recommendations for Future Research:
1. Obtain raw microdata from statistical offices
2. Conduct industry-specific analysis
3. Include part-time vs full-time employment analysis
4. Factor in cost of living adjustments
5. Analyze impact of specific policy changes
